## When to Report

Report any suspected security incident immediately, including:

- Unauthorized access to systems, files, or employee data
- Phishing attempts, credential theft, or social engineering
- Unexpected agent behavior (e.g., the Research Agent producing commands
  you did not request, or referencing data you did not provide)
- Anomalous data access patterns or tool misuse alerts
- Suspected prompt injection or AI system manipulation

**When in doubt, report it.** False positives are preferable to undetected incidents.

## How to Report

1. **Stop and preserve.** Do not attempt to remediate the incident yourself.
   Preserve all logs, screenshots, and session transcripts as evidence.

2. **Contact the SOC** at soc@northstar-tech.com

3. **Create an incident ticket** using the internal ticketing system:
   - Category: **Security Incident**
   - Priority: match to severity (see below)
   - Include: date/time, affected systems, description, your contact info

4. **If urgent or critical**, call the Security Hotline: **ext. 9-SECURITY (9-7328)**
